The acoustic set aired on MTV on December 16, 1993, and was later released as an album on November 1, 1994, following Kurt Cobain\u0026rsquo;s death. The performance stood out because it deviated from typical MTV Unplugged shows. Rather than focusing on their biggest hits, Nirvana delivered an emotional, stripped-down set filled with lesser-known songs and covers. The setlist included tracks like \u0026ldquo;About a Girl\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Come As You Are,\u0026rdquo; but much of the focus was on covers, including haunting renditions of Lead Belly’s \u0026ldquo;Where Did You Sleep Last Night,\u0026rdquo; David Bowie’s \u0026ldquo;The Man Who Sold the World,\u0026rdquo; and songs by The Vaselines and Meat Puppets (with members of the latter joining the performance). The atmosphere was dark and somber, with the stage decorated with black candles and lilies, resembling a funeral—an aesthetic reportedly suggested by Cobain. The emotional intensity of the performance, particularly the chilling finale of \u0026ldquo;Where Did You Sleep Last Night,\u0026rdquo; where Cobain\u0026rsquo;s voice breaks with raw power, has cemented it as a defining moment in Nirvana\u0026rsquo;s legacy. The album, released posthumously, won a Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album and remains a testament to Nirvana’s versatility, vulnerability, and Cobain’s enduring artistry.\nMy Favourite songs in this performance are Lake of fire, Where did you sleep last night and most famously known The man who sold the world.\nPrevious\rNextsads\rWith the light out \u0026ldquo;With the Lights Out\u0026rdquo; is a box set by Nirvana, released on November 23, 2004, through DGC Records.

The album provides a blend of intimate recordings and early versions of iconic songs, showcasing Kurt Cobain\u0026rsquo;s artistry and the band\u0026rsquo;s enduring influence on music.\nThis album is for the late night projects where you need to have alot of focus.\nHistory The Birth of Nirvana Nirvana was formed in 1987 in the small town of Aberdeen, Washington. Kurt Cobain, the band’s lead vocalist and guitarist, met bassist Krist Novoselic through their shared love of punk rock. After cycling through several drummers, the band finally solidified its lineup with Dave Grohl in 1990, whose powerful drumming became a key part of their sound.\nThe band’s early years were spent crafting their identity in the Pacific Northwest’s burgeoning grunge scene. Influenced by punk, heavy metal, and indie rock, Nirvana’s music fused raw emotion with melodic hooks, creating something entirely unique. Their first album, Bleach (1989), was released under the independent label Sub Pop and showcased their early sound—heavy, gritty, and unapologetically raw.\nThe Breakthrough: Nevermind (1991) Everything changed in 1991 with the release of Nevermind. The album’s lead single, “Smells Like Teen Spirit”, became an anthem almost overnight. Its infectious riff, Cobain’s raspy voice, and the accompanying chaotic music video captured the spirit of a generation.\nThe success of Nevermind was unprecedented. It knocked Michael Jackson’s Dangerous off the top of the Billboard 200 and introduced grunge to a mainstream audience. With hits like “Come as You Are”, “Lithium”, and “In Bloom”, the album sold over 30 million copies worldwide. Nirvana had gone from underground heroes to global rockstars.\nThe Height of Fame and In Utero (1993) As Nirvana’s fame skyrocketed, Cobain struggled with the pressures of stardom and his growing status as the voice of Generation X. The band’s third and final studio album, In Utero (1993), was a stark contrast to the polished sound of Nevermind. Produced by Steve Albini, it was darker, more abrasive, and deeply personal. Songs like “Heart-Shaped Box” and “All Apologies” revealed Cobain’s inner turmoil, while tracks like “Rape Me” challenged societal norms.\nDespite its raw sound, In Utero was a critical and commercial success, further cementing Nirvana’s place in music history.\nThe End of Nirvana Tragically, Nirvana’s story came to an abrupt end on April 5, 1994, when Kurt Cobain was found dead in his Seattle home. His death was ruled a suicide, and it marked the end of an era for the band and the grunge movement.\nThe loss of Cobain left a void in the music world, but Nirvana’s legacy only grew in the years that followed. Posthumous releases, including the MTV Unplugged in New York performance, showcased the band’s talent and emotional depth, solidifying their place as one of the most influential bands in rock history.\nLegacy Though their time together was brief, Nirvana’s impact on music and culture is immeasurable. They revolutionized the sound of rock, brought alternative music to the mainstream, and inspired countless artists across genres. Nirvana wasn’t just a band—it was a movement, a voice for the disenfranchised, and a reminder that music could be raw, real, and transformative.\nPrevious\rNextsads\rA Personal Reflection For me, Nirvana represents freedom—the freedom to be flawed, to be vulnerable, to be unapologetically yourself. Listening to their music feels like stepping into a different world, one where pain and beauty coexist in perfect harmony.\nKurt Cobain’s tragic death in 1994 marked the end of an era, but his spirit lives on in every riff, lyric, and fan who refuses to let go of the band’s legacy. Nirvana wasn’t just a band; it was a revolution.\n","date":"16 January 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/rants/nirvana/","section":"Rants","summary":"Nirvana: A Legacy of Grunge and Raw Emotion.","title":"'One baby to another said im lucky to met you'","type":"rants"},{"content":"","date":"16 January 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/","section":"Joseph Shay","summary":"","title":"Joseph Shay","type":"page"},{"content":"","date":"16 January 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/rants/","section":"Rants","summary":"","title":"Rants","type":"rants"},{"content":"\rProfile I achieved first place in the 2023 RoboCup IranOpen(secondary lightweight soccer) competition in which I was granted the opportunity to compete in Bordeaux France.

But here\u0026rsquo;s what changed my mind and why I decided to give it a shot.\nTo Inspire Others Blogs have incredible potential to inspire. Let me break it down.\nInspiration is a mix of two things: witnessing something extraordinary and realizing that you, too, can achieve it.\nI’ve felt this firsthand. At my first RoboCup in 2023, I was amazed by the extraordinary robots we faced. Talking to their creators made me realize that building such amazing machines was within my reach. The same thing happened at my first WRO in 2023—I saw what was possible if I just pushed myself.\nYou don’t always need direct contact with your role models to be inspired by them. The internet is filled with incredible resources.\nFor Recognition A blog can serve as a portfolio—a way to showcase my work for research, career opportunities, or even just to share with friends and family. It’s a window into what I’m building and why it matters.\nTo Share Knowledge During my time building competition robots, I spent countless hours poring over other teams’ blogs, CAD designs, and videos. Those resources were invaluable, helping me learn and grow.\nIsaac Newton famously said, “If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants.” We all build on the work of those who came before us. But to become a \u0026ldquo;giant\u0026rdquo; yourself, you need to share your knowledge and experiences.\nSomeone once said:\n“An engineer’s work isn’t complete until it’s documented.”\nAnd that stuck with me.\nPassing it On Others\u0026rsquo; websites have helped me a lot, so making my own blog is an attempt to pass it on.

It was a fascinating experience that combined my passion for robotics, engineering, and innovation with real-world problem-solving.\nUnderstanding the Challenge The factory lines at SNOWA are integral to their operations, producing high-quality products efficiently. However, like many modern industries, they faced challenges in optimizing their workflows, reducing human intervention in repetitive tasks, and ensuring consistency in production. My task was to design and implement automation solutions tailored to their unique needs.\nSpecifically, the factories required three types of robots:\nA robot to pack refrigerators.\nA robot to assemble the refrigerators\u0026rsquo; compressors and screw them in place.\nA 9-axis robotic arm for complex tasks requiring high precision and flexibility.\nPlanning the Automation Before diving into the technical aspects, I spent time observing the existing workflows, understanding the machinery, and identifying bottlenecks. This stage was crucial to ensure that the solutions I proposed would seamlessly integrate into their current systems without disrupting operations.\nSome key areas of focus included:\nStreamlining conveyor belt systems to ensure a smoother transition between production stages.\nIntegrating sensors to monitor product quality in real-time.\nDesigning robots with the dexterity and functionality required for specific tasks, such as packing and assembly.\nChallenges and Solutions Every project comes with its own set of challenges. For this one, the key hurdles included:\nEnsuring compatibility between new automation systems and older machinery.\nMinimizing downtime during the installation and testing phases.\nCalibrating sensors and robotic arms to function accurately in the factory environment.\nThrough careful planning, iterative testing, and open communication with the factory teams, these challenges were successfully overcome.\nThe Outcome By the end of the project, the SNOWA factories had more efficient, reliable, and scalable production lines. The automation systems not only enhanced productivity but also allowed the staff to focus on more critical and creative tasks. The robots, in particular, streamlined the packing and assembly processes, while the 9-axis arm opened up possibilities for even more intricate operations in the future.\nLooking Ahead This experience reaffirmed my belief in the transformative power of automation.

My team and I competed in the RoboMission Senior league. We achieved First Place and earned the Gold medal.\nScenario Our modern-day society relies on container shipments that transport all kinds of goods over the oceans. In the past, particular routes would involve ships having to take long, dangerous journeys around the edges of continents, such as around Cape Horn in South America or the Cape of Good Hope in Africa. But the construction of the Panama Canal and the Suez Canal have made it possible for ships to reach their destinations much faster and more safely. Many modern transport ships have even been built exactly according to the Panamax or the new Neopanamax standard: the maximum size for crossing the Panama Canal.\nStandardization and automation are other aspects that have made international transport over the sea more effective. The introduction of standard shipping containers is an example of this standardization. These containers can easily be transferred from a ship to a truck or a train, making transportation faster. In modern ports, many processes are automated, such as the unloading of containerships and even piloting of ships. Autonomous ships are even something we can expect to see in the near future.\nOn the Senior game field, the robot will help to load and unload ships, fuel them, and pilot them to open sea.\nOur Robot Most of the robots in the WRO competition are made with Lego EV3 Mindstorms, and so was ours.\nSpecs The main processor of our robot was an EV3. We had three medium motors, a large motor, and four color-IR sensors.\nDesign The coding of the robot was done with the Lego Mindstorms EV3 Software, and the design was done with Brick Studio 2.0.\nThe gripper was made with a rack system, and the line follower algorithm used was the PID algorithm.\nGallery One of our test runs Photos ","date":"11 August 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/projects/wro2023/","section":"Projects","summary":"The 2023 WRO RoboMission Senior","title":"2023 Iran WRO","type":"projects"},{"content":"\rIntro Back in 2023, I competed in the IranOpen 2023 RoboCup in Tehran for the RCJ Lightweight Soccer league with my team After X. We achieved First Place and represented Iran in the Bordeaux competition.\nOur Robot We had two robots with the same mechanical and electrical design but different code (one as goalkeeper and the other as an attacker). Specs Micro The brain of the robot is a STM32F405RGT6, which is 168MHz!!!\nMotors Our robots used the Maxon DCX16L, which is very sensitive and can reach speeds of up to 1000RPM with a 9V reading. Motor Drivers To drive the Maxon DCX16L, we used TB12FNG drivers for each motor (4 in total).\nMovement The robot\u0026rsquo;s movement was done with something called 4-wheel OmniDirectional Movement, which allows the robot to move in any direction. Ball Recognition Finding the ball on the field, which is an IR emitter ball, was done using TSSP sensors in a circular pattern.\nOut Recognition If the robot went out of the outline (white line around the field), it would be a foul, so we put a circular array of NJL sensors to detect the white line.\nGoal Detection The attacker robot had one OpenMV Cam H7 and detected the goal so that when we had the ball in our robot\u0026rsquo;s mouth, it would go toward the goal.\nGallery Fazili RC post One of our games Photos ","date":"25 April 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/projects/iranopen-robocup2023/","section":"Projects","summary":"The 2023 IranOpen RoboCup competition","title":"2023 IranOpen RoboCup","type":"projects"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Authors","type":"authors"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories","type":"categories"}]
