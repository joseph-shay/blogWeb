Here I will explain how.\nChoosing a Website Builder There are a lot of website builders out there, but the popular options are Blogger, Squarespace, WordPress, and Wix. These are relatively simple to set up and good options if you don’t want to debug or write code.\nWhat I used instead was Hugo, an open-source website builder. Here’s how it works:\nChoose a theme: I used Blowfish because it has a really minimalist look to it.\nRead the documentation on your theme.\nSet up your website how you like it and run it.\nI used an open-source website builder because, although it requires more programming setup, it looks neat. I didn’t have to write any HTML or CSS. That’s all handled by the theme. The setup was mostly reading documentation, adding features, and debugging random problems.\nYou can also build a website from scratch using React or other web development tools. I was too lazy to do this, but if you are interested in web development, that might be fun.\nPublishing The first step is to buy a domain from Cloudflare Domains.\nOnce you have your domain, you can publish your website for free using Cloudflare Pages.\n","date":"11 January 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/how-to-blog/","section":"Posts","summary":"How to create a blog website","title":"How to create a blog","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"11 January 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/series/making-a-blog/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Making a Blog","type":"series"},{"content":"","date":"11 January 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Posts","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"11 January 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/question/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Question","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"11 January 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series","type":"series"},{"content":"","date":"11 January 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"11 January 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/tutorial/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tutorial","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"11 January 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/why/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Why","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"10 January 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/rants/","section":"Rants","summary":"","title":"Rants","type":"rants"},{"content":"For me, the thought of starting a blog wasn’t even on my radar. But here\u0026rsquo;s what changed my mind and why I decided to give it a shot.\nTo Inspire Others Blogs have incredible potential to inspire. Let me break it down.\nInspiration is a mix of two things: witnessing something extraordinary and realizing that you, too, can achieve it.\nI’ve felt this firsthand. At my first RoboCup in 2023, I was amazed by the extraordinary robots we faced. Talking to their creators made me realize that building such amazing machines was within my reach. The same thing happened at my first WRO in 2023—I saw what was possible if I just pushed myself.\nYou don’t always need direct contact with your role models to be inspired by them. The internet is filled with incredible resources.\nFor Recognition A blog can serve as a portfolio—a way to showcase my work for research, career opportunities, or even just to share with friends and family. It’s a window into what I’m building and why it matters.\nTo Share Knowledge During my time building competition robots, I spent countless hours poring over other teams’ blogs, CAD designs, and videos. Those resources were invaluable, helping me learn and grow.\nIsaac Newton famously said, “If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants.” We all build on the work of those who came before us. But to become a \u0026ldquo;giant\u0026rdquo; yourself, you need to share your knowledge and experiences.\nSomeone once said:\n“An engineer’s work isn’t complete until it’s documented.”\nAnd that stuck with me.\nPassing it On Others\u0026rsquo; websites have helped me a lot, so making my own blog is an attempt to pass it on. Consider making a blog yourself! I’ve written a blog post on how to get started.\n","date":"10 January 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/rants/why-make-a-blog-page/","section":"Rants","summary":"Here I explain why I started a blog and why you should consider it too.","title":"Why Blog?","type":"rants"},{"content":"\rMy Experience at SNOWA Factories Today I had the incredible opportunity to visit the SNOWA factories to work on automating their factory lines. It was a fascinating experience that combined my passion for robotics, engineering, and innovation with real-world problem-solving.\nUnderstanding the Challenge The factory lines at SNOWA are integral to their operations, producing high-quality products efficiently. However, like many modern industries, they faced challenges in optimizing their workflows, reducing human intervention in repetitive tasks, and ensuring consistency in production. My task was to design and implement automation solutions tailored to their unique needs.\nSpecifically, the factories required three types of robots:\nA robot to pack refrigerators.\nA robot to assemble the refrigerators\u0026rsquo; compressors and screw them in place.\nA 9-axis robotic arm for complex tasks requiring high precision and flexibility.\nPlanning the Automation Before diving into the technical aspects, I spent time observing the existing workflows, understanding the machinery, and identifying bottlenecks. This stage was crucial to ensure that the solutions I proposed would seamlessly integrate into their current systems without disrupting operations.\nSome key areas of focus included:\nStreamlining conveyor belt systems to ensure a smoother transition between production stages.\nIntegrating sensors to monitor product quality in real-time.\nDesigning robots with the dexterity and functionality required for specific tasks, such as packing and assembly.\nChallenges and Solutions Every project comes with its own set of challenges. For this one, the key hurdles included:\nEnsuring compatibility between new automation systems and older machinery.\nMinimizing downtime during the installation and testing phases.\nCalibrating sensors and robotic arms to function accurately in the factory environment.\nThrough careful planning, iterative testing, and open communication with the factory teams, these challenges were successfully overcome.\nThe Outcome By the end of the project, the SNOWA factories had more efficient, reliable, and scalable production lines. The automation systems not only enhanced productivity but also allowed the staff to focus on more critical and creative tasks. The robots, in particular, streamlined the packing and assembly processes, while the 9-axis arm opened up possibilities for even more intricate operations in the future.\nLooking Ahead This experience reaffirmed my belief in the transformative power of automation. It’s exciting to think about how these advancements can revolutionize industries, improve efficiency, and open doors to new possibilities.\nI’m incredibly grateful to SNOWA for trusting me with this project and for the opportunity to contribute to their innovation journey.

My team and I competed in the RoboMission Senior league. We achieved First Place and earned the Gold medal.\nScenario Our modern-day society relies on container shipments that transport all kinds of goods over the oceans. In the past, particular routes would involve ships having to take long, dangerous journeys around the edges of continents, such as around Cape Horn in South America or the Cape of Good Hope in Africa. But the construction of the Panama Canal and the Suez Canal have made it possible for ships to reach their destinations much faster and more safely. Many modern transport ships have even been built exactly according to the Panamax or the new Neopanamax standard: the maximum size for crossing the Panama Canal.\nStandardization and automation are other aspects that have made international transport over the sea more effective. The introduction of standard shipping containers is an example of this standardization. These containers can easily be transferred from a ship to a truck or a train, making transportation faster. In modern ports, many processes are automated, such as the unloading of containerships and even piloting of ships. Autonomous ships are even something we can expect to see in the near future.\nOn the Senior game field, the robot will help to load and unload ships, fuel them, and pilot them to open sea.\nOur Robot Most of the robots in the WRO competition are made with Lego EV3 Mindstorms, and so was ours.\nSpecs The main processor of our robot was an EV3. We had three medium motors, a large motor, and four color-IR sensors.\nDesign The coding of the robot was done with the Lego Mindstorms EV3 Software, and the design was done with Brick Studio 2.0.\nThe gripper was made with a rack system, and the line follower algorithm used was the PID algorithm.\nGallery One of our test runs Photos ","date":"11 August 2023","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/projects/wro2023/","section":"Projects","summary":"The 2023 WRO RoboMission Senior","title":"2023 Iran WRO","type":"projects"},{"content":"\rIntro Back in 2023, I competed in the IranOpen 2023 RoboCup in Tehran for the RCJ Lightweight Soccer league with my team After X.
